#Connection options:
#-U username (if not specified current OS user is used).
#-p port.
#-h server hostname/address.

#Connect to a specific database:
psql -U postgres -h serverAddress -d dbName

#Get databases on a server:
psql -U postgres -h serverAddress --list

#Execute sql query and save output to file:
#Add -t to get only rows as result.
psql -U postgres -d dbName -c 'select * from tableName;' -o 'fileName'
